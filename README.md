Couplet Composer is the build script for [Obliging Ode](https://github.com/anttikivi/unsung-anthem) and [Unsung Anthem](https://github.com/anttikivi/unsung-anthem). It takes care of setting up the build environment, installing the dependencies, and building the project incrementally.

## Installing

While you can install Couplet Composer globally to you system, it is recommended that you use it via the helper scripts that come with [Obliging Ode](https://github.com/anttikivi/unsung-anthem) and [Unsung Anthem](https://github.com/anttikivi/unsung-anthem). Those script automatically install the up-to-date version of Couplet Composer and invoke it using the correct set of options.
